I will update `buzzer.py` to include:
1.  **More Songs**: I will add 4 more songs to the collection (e.g., Star Wars Imperial March, Nokia Ringtone, etc.) to make a total of 5.
2.  **`play_song(index)`**: A new method (or updated test function) that accepts an integer index (1-5) to play the corresponding song.
3.  **Updated `test_buzzer()`**:
    -   It will now accept an optional argument (or prompt the user if running interactively, though hardcoding for now is safer for automation) to play a specific song.
    -   I'll make it so if you run `test_buzzer(3)`, it plays song #3.

**Song List Plan:**
1.  **Super Mario Theme** (Already there)
2.  **Imperial March** (Star Wars)
3.  **Nokia Tune** (Classic)
4.  **Happy Birthday**
5.  **Jingle Bells**

I will restructure the code to store these songs in a dictionary or list for easy access.
